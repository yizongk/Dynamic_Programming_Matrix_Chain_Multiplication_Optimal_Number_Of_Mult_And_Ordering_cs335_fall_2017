i.   All part of the assignment were completed.
ii.  No bugs were encountered
iii. Be at the correct directory on the terminal, type in "make all" without quotes.
     This will generate one program with it's own way of command line:
         ./optimal_multplications [dimension file, typically dimensions_file.txt]
                            
iv.  Input files are four:
         "dimensions_file.txt" to populate the vector containing info about our matrices.

NOTES:
  * the dimension file should be one interger per line.
